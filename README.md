# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## Project Description
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two files: train.csv and test.csv, containing training and testing data respectively. The dataset includes information about houses such as their age, area, location, condition, and their sale price.

## Usage
- Setup Kaggle API: Ensure you have the Kaggle API installed and authenticated.
- Download Dataset: Download the House Prices dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
- Extract Dataset: Extract the downloaded dataset files.
- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and converting categorical variables to numerical ones.
- Modeling: Train different machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluation: Compare the performance of different models.
- Generate Predictions: Generate predictions on the test set.

## Models
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:

* Random Forest
* Decision Tree
* Ridge
* Lasso

## Conclusion
Based on the evaluation, the Random Forest model was selected for generating predictions on the test set.
